curry-resources
===============

This package provides the library `Language.Curry.Resources`
which contains definitions of various URLs to resources
related to Curry, like home page of Curry, the documentation site
for packages, etc. These URLs should be used in Curry applications
which generate documentations related to Curry, e.g.,
program documentations (CurryDoc), package descriptions,
instead of fixed strings so that the URLs can be easily adapted.
